# Automated Knowledge Graph Construction and Querying from Scientific Texts using Graph RAG: A Novel Pipeline for Entity Extraction and Relationship Synthesis

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel automated pipeline for constructing and querying knowledge graphs from scientific text, specifically designed for paragraphs extracted from PDF documents. The proposed Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution leverages Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy, semantic chunking with sentence transformers, embedding-based retrieval via ChromaDB, and Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Cypher query generation to automate the transformation of unstructured scientific text into a structured property graph in Neo4j. The system implements a two-phase approach: first constructing the knowledge graph through intelligent entity extraction and relationship synthesis, then enabling natural language querying through semantic retrieval and LLM-driven query generation. Experimental results demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness in automatically extracting entities, synthesizing relationships, and providing accurate answers to natural language queries through graph traversal. The proposed architecture addresses the critical need for scalable, automated knowledge graph construction from scientific literature while maintaining semantic accuracy and query flexibility.

## I. Introduction

### A. Background and Motivation
Knowledge graphs have emerged as essential tools for representing structured relationships among entities in scientific literature, enabling researchers to discover hidden connections and extract meaningful insights from large corpora. Traditional approaches to knowledge graph construction rely heavily on manual annotation and expert curation, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and do not scale effectively for large document collections. The exponential growth of scientific literature necessitates automated solutions that can transform unstructured text into structured knowledge representations while maintaining semantic accuracy.

### B. Problem Statement
Given a paragraph of scientific text extracted from a PDF document containing temporal information, factual data, and entity relationships, the primary challenge is to automatically construct a comprehensive knowledge graph (property graph) that accurately represents the entities and their interconnections. The system must then support intelligent querying using natural language, returning precise answers derived from the graph structure and relationships.

### C. Research Contributions
This work makes several key contributions to the field of automated knowledge graph construction:

1. **Novel Graph RAG Architecture**: A two-phase pipeline that separates graph construction from querying, enabling independent optimization of each component.
2. **Intelligent Entity Extraction**: Integration of spaCy's lightweight NER model with semantic chunking for context-aware entity identification.
3. **Automated Relationship Synthesis**: LLM-driven Cypher query generation that automatically creates semantically meaningful relationships between entities.
4. **Semantic Query Processing**: Natural language query understanding through entity extraction, semantic retrieval, and LLM-driven query generation.
5. **End-to-End Automation**: Complete pipeline from PDF text extraction to knowledge graph querying without human intervention.

### D. Paper Organization
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the related work and background, Section III details the problem formulation, Section IV describes the proposed methodology, Section V presents the experimental setup and results, Section VI discusses the findings and limitations, and Section VII concludes with future work directions.

## II. Related Work and Background

### A. Knowledge Graph Construction
Traditional knowledge graph construction approaches have relied on rule-based systems, supervised learning with annotated training data, and manual curation by domain experts. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning have enabled more automated approaches, including distant supervision, open information extraction, and neural-based methods.

### B. Named Entity Recognition in Scientific Text
NER systems for scientific text have evolved from rule-based approaches to deep learning models. spaCy's lightweight models have demonstrated effectiveness in biomedical and scientific text processing, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

### C. Graph RAG Systems
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have primarily focused on text generation tasks. The application of RAG principles to knowledge graph construction and querying represents a novel approach that combines the benefits of semantic retrieval with structured knowledge representation.

### D. Semantic Embeddings and Vector Databases
Sentence transformers and vector databases like ChromaDB have revolutionized semantic search and similarity computation, enabling efficient retrieval of semantically related entities and text chunks.

## III. Problem Formulation

### A. Input Specification
The system takes as input a paragraph of scientific text \(T = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}\) where each \(s_i\) represents a sentence or semantic chunk. The text contains entities \(E = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_m\}\) of various types (dates, measurements, chemical compounds, biological entities, etc.) and implicit relationships \(R = \{r_1, r_2, ..., r_k\}\) between these entities.

### B. Output Specification
The system produces:
1. A knowledge graph \(G = (V, E, L)\) where:
   - \(V\) represents the set of entity nodes
   - \(E\) represents the set of relationship edges
   - \(L\) represents the set of labels and properties
2. A query processing system that can answer natural language queries \(Q\) by traversing the graph and returning structured results \(A\).

### C. Technical Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system must handle paragraphs of varying lengths and complexity
- **Accuracy**: Entity extraction and relationship synthesis must maintain high precision
- **Efficiency**: Query processing must return results in real-time
- **Flexibility**: The system must accommodate various scientific domains and entity types

## IV. Proposed Methodology

### A. System Architecture Overview
The proposed Graph RAG pipeline consists of two main phases:
1. **Graph Construction Phase**: Entity extraction, embedding, storage, and relationship synthesis
2. **Query Processing Phase**: Natural language understanding, semantic retrieval, and answer generation

### B. Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Construction

#### 1. Text Extraction and Preprocessing
The pipeline begins with PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF (`fitz`), which provides robust text extraction capabilities for scientific documents. The extracted text is preprocessed to remove formatting artifacts and normalize whitespace.

#### 2. Entity Extraction and Classification
Entities are extracted using spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model, which provides lightweight yet effective NER capabilities. The extraction process identifies entities across multiple categories:
- **Temporal entities**: Dates, time periods, durations
- **Quantitative entities**: Measurements, concentrations, dosages
- **Named entities**: Chemical compounds, biological entities, system components
- **Reference entities**: Table references, figure citations

Each extracted entity \(e_i\) is represented as:
\[e_i = (text_i, label_i, position_i, confidence_i)\]

#### 3. Entity Embedding and Storage
Entities are embedded using the SentenceTransformers library with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, which provides a good balance between embedding quality and computational efficiency. The embedding process transforms each entity text into a 384-dimensional vector:

\[embedding_i = \text{SentenceTransformer}(text_i)\]

These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for efficient semantic similarity search, while the entity metadata (text, label, position) is stored as nodes in Neo4j. This dual storage approach enables both semantic retrieval and graph traversal operations.

#### 4. Semantic Chunking
The paragraph is segmented into semantically meaningful chunks using sentence boundaries and topic coherence. Each chunk \(c_j\) is embedded using the same sentence transformer model:

\[chunk\_embedding_j = \text{SentenceTransformer}(c_j)\]

#### 5. Relationship Synthesis via LLM
For each semantic chunk, the system:
1. Retrieves semantically similar entities from ChromaDB using cosine similarity
2. Generates Cypher queries using an LLM (Llama3 via Ollama) to create relationships
3. Executes the generated queries in Neo4j to build the knowledge graph

The LLM prompt engineering follows strict guidelines to ensure valid Cypher syntax:
- Single CREATE statement per relationship
- Proper variable naming conventions
- Valid property structures
- Semantic relationship directionality

### C. Phase 2: Knowledge Graph Querying

#### 1. Query Understanding and Entity Extraction
Natural language queries are processed using the same NER pipeline to extract relevant entities. The system identifies query entities and retrieves corresponding nodes from the knowledge graph.

#### 2. Semantic Retrieval and Context Building
Relevant entities are retrieved from ChromaDB based on semantic similarity to the query, providing context for graph traversal.

#### 3. Cypher Query Generation
An LLM generates Cypher MATCH queries based on the extracted entities and semantic context, ensuring optimal graph traversal patterns.

#### 4. Result Processing and Answer Generation
Query results are processed and converted to natural language answers using an LLM, providing human-readable responses based on the graph structure.

### D. Implementation Details

- **Node Properties**: text, label, confidence, position
- **Relationship Types**: Semantic relationships (RELATES_TO, HAS_VALUE, IS_PART_OF, etc.)
- **Relationship Properties**: Contextual information and confidence scores

#### 3. API Integration
The system integrates with Ollama through HTTP API calls:
```bash
curl --location 'http://home-pc.tail4924f5.ts.net:11434/api/generate' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "model": "llama3",

    "stream": false
}'
```
